# Readme
This repo is the assignment work for course Getting and Cleaning Data. 

It contains a codebook "CodeBook.md" which explains the variables and the data operations and a script "run_analysis.R" which can be used to run the analysis. This script contains urls to the data and any data operations needed to create the final output.

You can find more about the data here: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/00240/UCI%20HAR%20Dataset.names
